## 📌 Overview

This repository is a **comprehensive Golang fundamentals portfolio** that demonstrates **core programming concepts, logical problem solving, and idiomatic Go practices**.

Unlike advanced concurrency-focused Go projects, this repository emphasizes:
- Strong command of **Go language basics**
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and input/output
- Pointers and memory concepts
- Structs and data modeling
- Pattern-based problem solving

This repository is especially valuable for **entry-to-mid-level Go, Backend, and Systems Programming interviews**, where **clarity of fundamentals** is critical.

## 🧠 How This Fits Into My Portfolio

This repository forms the **foundation layer** of my Go expertise and supports my work in:
- Advanced concurrency (worker pools, goroutines)
- Backend API development
- Systems programming
- Cloud-native services

It proves I have **strong fundamentals before moving to advanced topics**.

---

## ⚙️ How to Run Programs

```bash
go version
go run learn-go/hello_world.go
go run learn-go/for_loop.go
go run learn-go/pointers/pointerconcepts.go
go run learn-go/structs_in_go/structsconcepts.go
```

---

## 🧾 Points 

- Built strong **Golang programming fundamentals**, covering control flow, loops, functions, pointers, and structs.  
- Solved **pattern-based logic problems** to demonstrate loop mastery and problem-solving skills.  
- Implemented **struct-based data models** and nested structures for realistic use cases.  
- Gained deep understanding of **pointer behavior and memory concepts in Go**.  
- Established a solid foundation for **backend, systems, and concurrent programming in Golang**.

---

## 🧠 I Points

- “Go has a simple syntax but strong type safety.”
- “Pointers help avoid unnecessary copying.”
- “Structs are Go’s primary data modeling tool.”
- “Pattern problems test loop and logic clarity.”
